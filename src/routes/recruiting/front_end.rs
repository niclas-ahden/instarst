            <h3>"The Company"</h3>
            <p>
                "A well-established company in Tyresö which helps Sweden's largest retailers with their in-store communication (price signs, offers etc.). They offer a market-leading software that is used by thousands of stores to create, print, and publish signage. It's developed in-house by an experienced team and they're now transitioning it from a desktop app to a modern web app which you'll help build."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're 34 employees, of which 10 work in the IT department. Everyone has a big impact on the direction and design of their products, there's no overbearing bureaucracy, and decisions can be made quickly."
            </p>
            <h3>"The position"</h3>
            <p>
                "You will be developing the next version of Sweden's leading retail signage software. It's a major project that is highly requested by customers and will enable both reaching new customers and improving the whole product."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You'll start this project from scratch together with a back-end developer whom is being recruited at the same time as you. You'll get to make the technical decisions to make this a success, while having no tech debt to hold you back, and you'll have the whole team from the current software to rely on for assistance. You won't be in a silo."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The project will be led by the same Product Owner whom designed and led the development of the current software, so you'll have ample access to domain knowledge, clear feature requirements, and customer understanding."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You'll build a user-friendly, performant, and well-built front-end for designing retails signs (think " <a href="www.canva.com">"www.canva.com"</a>")."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The front-end will be written in TypeScript (probably React, but we'll decide on that together) and we're open to different languages on the back-end (we'll prioritize finding a great candidate and then use the language that they're most comfortable with)."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We think we've got a rare opportunity to write a great piece of software from scratch which will quite literally be the best of its kind in the country (and perhaps carry the company into other markets as well). We're looking forward to your application!"
